# Vim syntax highlighting

Contains syntax highlighting for the vim code editor.

## Install

To install, simply copy the contents of the `src` directory (not the directory itself) to your vim
configuration directory (usually `~/.vim`).

## Usage

The plugin will automatically highlight any file with a `.peg` extension. If you would care to
change this, you can adjust it by altering the `ftdetect/canopy.vim` file.
